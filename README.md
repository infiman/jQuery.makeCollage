jQuery.makeCollage
==================

jQuery plugin for making interactive photo collages.

It's very simple to use:

1) This plugin works with jQuery API, so you need to include it to your project.

2) Add jquery.makeCollage.js or min.js to your project.

3) If you want just make collage without hover type this in your js file:
			
			$(".class_or_#id_of_collage").makeCollage(maxHeight, whiteSpaceWidth);
			
4) If you want hover effect just type this:

			$(".class_or_#id_of_collage").makeHover();
			
			or play with CSS3 transforms.
			
Also don't be shy to fork it :)
Have a nice day!
